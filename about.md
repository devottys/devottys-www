# The Devottys

In 2021, Saul Pwanson founded [the devottys](), a merry band of digital artisans, devoted to the creation of delightful tools and diversions for the terminal.

Currently the party consists of:

- [Saul Pwanson](), Data Wizard
- [Anja Kefala](), Code Cleric
- [Dwimmer](), Symbol Sorcerer

## History

Our software works in concert with VisiData, often as a plugin.
This data-oriented approach to user interfaces means powerful data selection and editing are only a few keypresses away.

## The Modern Terminal

There has been a surge of interest in [BBSes]() and [the CLI]() in the past few years.
The [text art scene]() uses the character sets, fonts, and colors of yesteryear for nostalgic effect; and [block art]() is generally enlarged pixel art.
The actual functional utilities are CLI, and constrain themselves to minor improvements on the shell, which is itself a minor improvement over the teletype.

These days, the vast majority of people have access to modern terminals that support:

- full-screen mode
- Unicode (the BMP, via the Unifont), including full-width characters
- 256 colors (our software degrades gracefully to 16 colors)
- mouse button presses (though a mouse is never necessary to use our software)

# Mission

Our software fits within a terminal window, but that is not a constraint; for us, the terminal is an asset.

The terminal endures not because it has so much, but because it needs so little.

Terminal software often surpasses graphical software, in terms of speed and flexibility and empowerment.

Where others go big, we go small.
Where others are careless, we take great care.
Where others do it for money, we do it for love.

Money can only buy **big** software; it can't buy **great** software.


# Dreams

The BlueBird Shell (BBS) is our dream of well-designed, carefully-created terminal software that is robust, ergonomic, delightful, and most of all, useful.
We hope someday to launch a hosted version of our softwares, so that anyone with a computer can experience the delight of computing at terminal velocity.

If you share this dream, [please support me on patreon]().
