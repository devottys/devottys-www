## bluebird.sh

BlueBird Shell is a showcase of terminal software written and maintained by the [Devottys](https://github.com/devottys), a merry band of digital artisans who have devoted themselves to creating delightful tools and useful diversions in the terminal.

Many of our tools are based on [VisiData](https://visidata.org), because.. well, if you used VisiData, you'd know why.

Currently the party consists of:

- [Saul Pwanson](https://saul.pw), Data Sourceror
- [Anja Kefala](https://anja.kefala.info), Code Cleric
- [Dwimmer](https://www.instagram.com/dwimmer.tm/), Rune Bard

## Quality Terminal Software

Our software fits within a terminal window, but that is not a constraint; for us, the terminal is an asset.
Our tools are an "integrating development environment", in the spirit of the UNIX philosophy, and actively work to interface with other tools.

The terminal endures not because it has so much, but because it needs so little.  In many cases, terminal software surpasses graphical software, in terms of speed and flexibility and empowerment.

Where others grow big, we stay small.
Where others are sloppy, we take great care.
Where others aim for classic, we aim for timeless.

## Modern Terminal Features

The terminal has been a remarkably stable platform, which is no small part of its allure.  There has been some progress in the past 30 years, however.  In 2021, the year the Devottys were founded, the vast majority of terminals supported:

- full-screen interfaces ("TUI")
- Unicode, including full-width characters
- 256 colors (our software degrades gracefully to 16 colors)
- mouse clicks (though a mouse is never necessary to use our software)
